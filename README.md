# SimpleUIGallery-Android
A multi-functional Gallery app featuring an easy to use top to bottom slide view, as well as the features of File Rename, Delete, Rotation, View Properties and more!

# Challenges Overcame
Handling Image rotation, as well as File delete events was complicated. The app automatically refreshes every time an image is edited or deleted, to show these changes!

# How to use
Pretty self-explanatory. A single slide is enough to quickly check all your photos!
